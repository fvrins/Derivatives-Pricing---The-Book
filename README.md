This repository provides the supplementary material for the book by Frédéric Vrins, "Derivatives Pricing", Cambridge University Press, 2025. See https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/derivatives-pricing/D315080AC34EB3ACCF32F460D33E43F7#overview

The repository contains several zip archives featuring
  - R codes associated with the examples and figures in the book
  - R codes associated with the examples and figures in the slides
  - Latex (source) files of the slides
  - PDF of the slides (handouts and beamer versions; beamer meaning that you have the breaks and some bonus slides that I share with the students attending my classes)

Remarks:
  - The code is written for pedagogical purposes about the corresponding concepts, not to be computationally efficient in terms of speed/memory.
  - I do not share the solutions manual. We agreed with Cambridge University Press that the latter will only be provided to instructors from recognized higher education institutions.

Should you think there is a typo or mistake, please don't hesitate to contact me at frederic.vrins[at]uclouvain.be.

Enjoy !
